#
# Beginning from Windows Vista until Windows 10, Windows stores the Search
# index inside an Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database located at
# C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Application\Windows\Windows.edb. For
# Windows Server 2008 until Windows Server 2022, Stroz Friedberg observed that
# the database was structured the same way, but that Search Indexer was not
# enabled by default. The service is enabled by default on non-Server Windows
# versions.
#
# In Windows 11, this data is stored in the same directory, but the single ESE
# database is replaced by SQLite database files called Windows.db and
# Windows-gather.db
