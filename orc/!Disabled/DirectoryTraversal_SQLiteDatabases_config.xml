    <!--Please note this Target will not grab SQLite databases for Chromium-based browsers as those files usually don't have a file extension, i.e. the filenames are History, Media History, etc, but they are still SQLite databases-->
    <!--Searching by file header is the only true way to find every SQLite database across an entire drive, but this Target combined with SQLiteDatabases Target will grab most, if not all of the useful databases known to be of forensic value-->
    <!--Also please note that just because a file has an extension that fits the above does not mean it's a SQLite database. The best way to verify is to throw the file into a SQLite DB Viewer-->
