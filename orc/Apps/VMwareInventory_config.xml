    <!--VMware Workstation Pro stores a file named inventory.vmls which will provide file paths to Virtual Machines located on the user's system.-->
    <!--Important evidence could be located within these Virtual Machines so this is great information to know.-->
    <!--Preferences.ini will provide other file paths relating to the existing Virtual Machines on the user's system.-->
    <!--Inventory.vmls can be viewed in any text editor and provides similar information to Preferences.ini.-->
