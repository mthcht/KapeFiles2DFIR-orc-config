    <!--N/A-->
    <!--This directory contained the following files in my research VM:-->
    <!--C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\PeaZip\conf-lastgood.txt-->
    <!--C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\PeaZip\custedit.txt-->
    <!--C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\PeaZip\bookmarks.txt-->
    <!--C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\PeaZip\conf.txt-->
    <!--The two conf*.txt files contained a history of archives that were recently opened with PeaZip-->
    <!--Each file was identical to each other and had 650ish lines of data after about 10 minutes of testing with PeaZip. Except much more for a user who uses PeaZip as their primary archiving program-->
    <!--Bookmarks.txt appeared to contain entries for the default bookmarks that ship with PeaZip as well as user added bookmarks-->
    <!--Within this file, it stores the equivalent  to a Shellbags-esque timestamp for the first time the user navigated to the bookmark and the last time-->
    <!--The most recently visited timestamp is overwritten each time the user visits that bookmark and a number above the timestamps is incremented for each visits-->
    <!--For instance, my Bookmarks.txt had this entry:-->
    <!--4-->
    <!--2021-03-28 15:37:36-->
    <!--2021-03-28 11:02:20-->
    <!--0-->
