    <!--AceText is made by the same people who make Edit Pad Pro, PowerGREP, etc. It's a cool program that serves as a Clipboard extension tool.-->
    <!--From a forensic perspective, the entirety of a user's clipboard history is available for our perusal!-->
    <!--Once you have the .atc file, you can open with any text editor and see the entire history of a user's clipboard contents.-->
    <!--The copied text will be found between the &lt;text&gt; and &lt;/text&gt; parameters.-->
    <!--If content is copied from a webpage, copied text will be the same as above but there will also be a &lt;url&gt; and &lt;/url&gt; parameter which will display the URL from which the contents were copied from.-->
    <!--In addition to the above, the kind= parameter will provide clues as to where the contents were copied from.-->
