    <!--Snagit is an awesome, premium screen capturing software that is totally worth looking into.-->
    <!--Captures with Snagit are stored as .SNAG files, which can be opened with Snagit Editor.-->
    <!--Think of Snagit as Snipping Tool on steroids. The user can create robust diagrams and guides on top of the captured image.-->
    <!--This target will grab all the contents of the DataStore folder.-->
