    <!--Tablacus Explorer is a free, open-source orthodox file manager that is completely portable. No installation is needed. Therefore, the registry is not touched nor are there reliable file system locations for artifacts.-->
    <!--However, the .\AppData\Local\Temp\ directory may come in handy. I noticed that copies of the XML files in my local Tablacus Explorer folder were located there.-->
    <!--My folder path had dtemp-d2fffa101683078-60.dop in place of the asterisk, so I'm guessing that's randomized with each install. As a precaustion, I used an asterisk.-->
    <!--Window and Window1.xml will have information regarding to what the user had open in each window at the time.-->
    <!--Please note that Tablacus Explorer has an add-on for up to 9 tabs to be open at once.-->
    <!--Remember.xml is likely tied to the plugin "Remember folder view settings" that ships with Tablacus Explorer. It can be disabled at any time.-->
